                <h3>Week 4</h3>
                <div class="date">07/05/19</div>
                <p>
                    During this week we used Adobe XD to create subpages. We also played around with UI and created a
                    link under "Course Resources" on "My XD" that would take you to my UI template. We also thought
                    about topics and ideas we could do for our Custom UI Design Project.

                <p>
                    During this week, we did Photoshop and Adobe XD. In Photoshop, we edited our photos and transported
                    our hand drawn drawings into digital. We were also introduced to Adobe XD, which is a great platform
                    for web designers. Adobe XD is used to visualize what we want our website to look like. Adobe XD is
                    very easy to use and has simple tools that can make your website look presentable.

                <div class="date">06/21/2019</div>
                <p>We continued to experiment HTML and CSS. I learned how to do gradience, instead of using a bold
                    color. Eventually, I began learning how to insert photos and how to edit them to make it look
                    presentable on my site. I did this by adding blur so that the text pops up and centered it. During
                    this week, we also searched for fonts and I learned that you could looks for some on
                    Googlefonts.com. I
                    made some several changes such as changing the body color to black, to match my theme. Overall, I
                    customized and experimented...</p>

                <h3>Week 1</h3>
                <div class="date">06/14/2019</div>
                <p>Monday was our first day of Web Design. We started off by creating our accounts, on github and
                    creative media. Then, in the following days, we were introduced to HTML and CSS, and eventually
                    began coding. At first, it was complicated because we were introduced to new apps. We started
                    working on our
                    website from around Wednesday to Friday, and it
                    was not easy. Luckily, Mr.G had the class watch him demonstrate before we started on our own. I
                    became more familiar and comfortable with the codes and started customizing (a bit). I also played
                    around with the colors and fonts. I didn't do
                    much, but I was impressed that there was a way to create websites from scratch. Goodbye, Weebly :)
